# Tic Tac Toe Game - Windows Forms App
I took a C# Programming class at Irvine Valley College in Fall 2019. There were 2 related projects I worked on. The first was a 2 player Tic Tac Toe game and the other one was a single player Tic Tac Toe game playing the computer. In this project which was not part of the class, I combined these 2 projects so the user can choose to play a 1 or 2 players game.
